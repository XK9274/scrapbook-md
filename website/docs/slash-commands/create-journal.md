# Create Journal Entry

**Description**: Document daily progress, reflections, and development notes  
**Allowed Tools**: run_in_terminal, Python CLI

## Instructions

1. **Analyze current conversation for achievements**
2. **Generate meaningful title with date**
3. **Summarize key accomplishments**
4. **Note blockers and solutions**
5. **Create journal entry via scrap CLI**
6. **Add relevant tags for searchability**

## Implementation Steps

1. Extract journaling content from context:
   - Tasks completed today
   - Problems solved
   - New insights or learning
   - Blockers encountered
   - Next steps identified

2. Generate meaningful title:
   - Format: "[Main Achievement] - [Date]"
   - Examples: "Authentication System Complete - 2025-07-28"
   - Fallback: "Daily Progress - [Date]"

3. Structure journal content:
   ```markdown
   ## Goals Achieved
   - [List completed tasks/goals]
   
   ## Technical Implementation
   - [Key technical decisions or implementations]
   
   ## Blockers Resolved
   - [Problems that were solved and how]
   
   ## Learnings
   - [New insights or knowledge gained]
   
   ## Next Steps
   - [What to focus on tomorrow/next]
   ```

4. Determine relevant tags:
   - Project names
   - Technologies used
   - Types of work (development, debugging, research)
   - Date-based tags (weekly, monthly milestones)

5. Create journal entry:
   ```bash
   cd /home/mattpc/HueTesting/scrapbook-md
   ./scrap journal "Entry Title - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" "## Goals Achieved
   [achievements]
   
   ## Technical Implementation  
   [technical details]
   
   ## Blockers Resolved
   [solutions]
   
   ## Next Steps
   [tomorrow's focus]" --tags="daily,$(date +%Y-%m),project-name"
   ```

6. Confirm and suggest review:
   ```bash
   echo "Journal entry created for $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   echo "View recent entries: ./scrap list --type=journal --recent=7"
   ```

## Example Usage

Development progress:
```bash
./scrap journal "Hue Bridge Integration Complete - 2025-07-28" "## Goals Achieved
- Successfully connected to Philips Hue Bridge API
- Implemented light control commands
- Added error handling for network timeouts

## Technical Implementation
- Used requests library for HTTP communication
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added configuration validation for bridge IP

## Blockers Resolved
- Authentication issue resolved by implementing proper API key workflow
- Network timeout handling improved with connection pooling

## Next Steps
- Add support for light groups
- Implement scene management
- Write unit tests for API integration" --tags="daily,2025-07,hue,api,integration"
```

Bug fix session:
```bash
./scrap journal "Memory Leak Investigation - 2025-07-28" "## Goals Achieved
- Identified source of memory leak in renderer component
- Implemented proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Verified fix with memory profiling

## Technical Implementation
- Added cleanup functions to all event listeners
- Implemented proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Used WeakMap for component references

## Learnings
- React DevTools Profiler is invaluable for memory debugging
- Event listeners are common source of memory leaks
- Proper cleanup prevents accumulation of stale references

## Next Steps
- Add automated memory leak detection to CI
- Document memory management best practices
- Review other components for similar issues" --tags="daily,2025-07,debugging,memory,react"
```

## Title Examples
- "CLI Refactoring Complete - 2025-07-28"
- "Database Migration Success - 2025-07-28"  
- "Performance Optimization Results - 2025-07-28"
- "Testing Framework Setup - 2025-07-28"
- "API Design Session - 2025-07-28"

## Tag Strategy
- Always include "daily" for daily entries
- Add year-month (2025-07) for temporal organization
- Include project name for filtering
- Add technology tags for technical searches
- Use activity tags (debugging, development, research)
