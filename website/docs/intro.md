# Welcome

Your personal knowledge wiki for capturing **ideas**, **prompts**, and **todos**.

Think of it as a dev companion - Generally in VS Code i have multiple terminals open at any time, meaning from any terminal i can quickly capture an idea, prompt, or todo without needing to switch context or open a separate app.

You can use the slash commands in VS Code, terminal environments, or any Claude interface. See **[Slash Commands](./slash-commands)** for Claude-compatible automation. 

Scrapbook is a lightweight documentation system that combines a powerful CLI tool with a modern web interface. Organize your thoughts, track tasks, store prompts, and maintain workflowsâ€”all in markdown format.

## What You Can Do

- **Manage Tasks** - Track todos with priorities and status
